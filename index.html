            <div class="words line2">Dear Kai,</div>
            <div class="words line3">Hallowww it's me again, sana hindi ka pa nagsasawa sakin HAHAHAHA. I already said a lot noong Christmas but I have a little more to say. I know things are not the best right now, I have said and done some things that made you sad or hurt. I want to sincerely say sorry without any excuse. Slowly but surely I am beginning to learn how to handle what we have right now. Sabi mo nga you value what we are building and I deserve to know the real you, and I was glad to hear that. So you can be as transparent to me as you want, your story is safe with me. When I say and do something wrong please do tell me, because I want to treat you the way you deserve to be treated, without feeling insecure.</div>
            <div class="words line4">I am very happy to enter 2026 with you. I promise to be more honest and communicate more properly with you. Again, what we have really matters to me and I want us to continue growing with each other. HAPPY NEW YEAR LEXIE!!!!</div>
